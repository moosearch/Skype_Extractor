Tech Notes
===========

I used Visual Studio 2013 to develop this application. I also 
ended up using two packages; EntityFrameWork(6.1.1) and the 
SQLite adapter from ADO.NET.

Current things to work out:
 - Restructuring code to become more event-driven and readable
 - Designing a better UI
    - Includes providing better feedback
